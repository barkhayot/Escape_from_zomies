# Experince and about project :

  > The Game has Simple Algorithm and Simple meaning. Student or The gyu should escape from running zombies. Well I spent 2 days for this version of project and that was enough fun to play with python libraries. Much shorter isnt it? Yeah for fisrt game as I remember I spent about 1 week and that was quite chalenging for me. I am not realy sure that I will keep coding on Pygame but I would recommend it for beginners to try it. 
  
  
  # For those who want change it and make better : 
  > I tried to finish this project as quick as possible that's why on source code there can be some bugs and code is not really clean to understand. If you guys want to change it and make better version of this you can clone it and add your changes. I will be happy to commit your changes :)
